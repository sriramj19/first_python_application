# first_python_application

__author__ = "Sriram Jayaraman"

This is my first python application uploaded on Git. This is a simple application based upon LAMP (Linux, Apache, MySQL, Python) on Ubuntu Linux Distribution. The Python source file "pyNameChecker.py" is the sole uploaded file as the rest is not portable onto Git. The overview of the application is as follows:

pyNameChecker is an application that is used to check the name on a guest list stored in the MySQL database. Whenever the user enters a name it checks whether the name is in the database or otherwise adds their name to the database and welcomes them aboard.

This simple application illustrates database creation and manipluation using Python in a very simple and efficient manner.

Note: The Python version used is Python2. The older version is used as the author is having technical difficulties with newer versions of Python and has used Python2 as it is the default Python version in Ubuntu. As you may see the author has pointed symbolic link to usr/bin/python which is the author's python working directory. You may remove or change it according to your IDE and working directory. If you have no technical difficulties with using Python3 change all 'raw_input' to 'input' as 'raw_input' has been eradicated in Python3. Additionally, it would be required to change all print statements from "" to () syntactically. These changes are within the confines of the current application only.

Have fun Python style...
